The site includes interactive features that allow you to compare, annotate, and create playlists with objects in the archiveâ€”translating live dance performance for preservation and accessibility while highlighting the interconnected themes at play.\n\nBy expanding the genre of Black dance and interrupting the systematic erasure of names lost to the archive, the No Boundaries Digital Archive reveals the tenacity and diversity of Black performance.",
